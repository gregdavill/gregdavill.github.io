You can find the updated files here: https://github.com/gregdavill/d20-hardware/tree/main/pcb/led-panels/d20_tri_r0.3 I&amp;rsquo;ve also released a r1.0 version, which is the same layout, but I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the SKiDL source for the design so that it correctly produces a BOM, I&amp;rsquo;ve also added some alternatives to the BOM.</description></item><item><title>Allwinner S3 SoC: Accelerated h.264</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/allwinner-s3-videoencoders/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 21:00:00 +1030</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/allwinner-s3-videoencoders/</guid><description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been using an Allwinner S3 SoC for experiments with the FLIR Boson. The description from the website sums the device up nicely:
S3 is a high cost-effective video encoding processor jointly developed by Zhuhai Allwinner Technology Co., Ltd. (&amp;ldquo;Allwinner&amp;rdquo;) and Sochip Technology Co., Ltd. (&amp;ldquo;Sochip&amp;rdquo;). Its built-in single-core ARM Cortex-A7 runs at 1.2GHz with 1Gbit DRAM (DDR3) , supporting numerous peripheral devices. The Chip package is 234 balls FBGA package, size 11mm x 11mm , suitable for various types of product development.</description></item><item><title>MSP430 custom ezFET Lite</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/ezfet-summary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 21:00:00 +1030</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/ezfet-summary/</guid><description>Summary Texas Instruments has a range of 16 bit microcontrollers, the MSP430. To program these require what they call a Flash Emulation Tool (FET).
Thankfully all their affordable development kits contain a small stripped down FET, known as the ezFET Lite. TI has open sourced this design and provide both the firmware and the schematics. I was given a tag-connect cable as a giveaway through the 43oh, MSP430 community forum.</description></item><item><title>Dell XPS13 RAM Upgrade (7390)</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/dell-xps13-ram-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 21:59:39 +1030</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/dell-xps13-ram-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d recently bought a new XPS13 7390 (non 2-in-1) laptop.

&lt;p>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s true this project did get dropped for awhile, it&amp;rsquo;s been about 3 years since the last blog post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2,400 LED icosahedron (20 sided)</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/d20/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2021 21:00:00 +1030</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/d20/</guid><description>A tennis ball sized, 20 sided, LED clad, regular polyhedron
Introduction The major challenge of making a smaller LED cube in my opinion is the LED panels. Commercially available panels are designed for video walls and typically made at 64x64 pixel as a minimum size. This seems to be a good trade off between cost/complexity/light efficiency. On my previous project mini-led-cube I had overcome one of the major hurdles of creating a smaller cube, because I had designed and built my own custom high density* LED panels.</description></item><item><title>Boson Frame Grabber Part 5</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt5/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt5/</guid><description>Details about the SoC architecture in the Boson Frame Grabber</description></item><item><title>Boson Frame Grabber Part 4</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt4/</guid><description>&lt;p>The new hardware for the Boson Frame Grabber will be based around the Lattice ECP5 family. Lattice make available a free IDE for this FPGA assuming you are not using a model with embedded SERDES. Since we are not, it&amp;rsquo;s perfect for our application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boson Frame Grabber Part 3</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt3/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this part I want to talk about the firmware, or code, this device will need in order to operate as I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boson Frame Grabber Part 2</title><link>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gregdavill.com/posts/boson-frame-grabber-pt2/</guid><description>&lt;p>In part 1, I discussed the version 1 prototype I had built.
