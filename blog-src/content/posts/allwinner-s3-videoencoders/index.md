## Introduction

I've been using an Allwinner S3 SoC for experiments with the FLIR Boson. The description from the website sums the device up nicely:

> S3 is a high cost-effective video encoding processor jointly developed by Zhuhai Allwinner Technology Co., Ltd. ("Allwinner") and Sochip Technology Co., Ltd. ("Sochip").
> Its built-in single-core ARM Cortex-A7 runs at 1.2GHz with 1Gbit DRAM (DDR3) , supporting numerous peripheral devices. The Chip package is 234 balls FBGA package, size 11mm x 11mm , suitable for various types of product development.

What was appealing to me for use with the Boson thermal camera is the compact BGA package, the internal DRAM, and embedded ethernet 100 Mbit PHY.
Interestingly the CPU used inside is the same as the V3/V3s/S3, there is mainline kernel and uboot support. This is good because I'm very much an embedded Linux beginner.

After following the reference design provided by SOChip, along with some other great OSHW projects:
* [https://github.com/Jana-Marie/OtterCam-s3](OtterCam-s3)
* [https://github.com/Ottercast/OtterCastAudioV2](OtterCast) 
* [https://github.com/OLIMEX/S3-OLinuXino](S3-OLinuXino)

I had a custom board designed. After some quick assembly I had a board that powered up.
Soon after that with a custom buildroot project, and had linux 5.18 booted on the board. ðŸ™Œ

## H264 Encoder

After some initial testing with libopenh264 with ffmpeg the performance is not great. Achieving only a few fps encoding an incoming USB UVC stream into h264. Not a dealbreaker for this project.

The S3 contains a hardware encoding block that claims performance of 120FPS, this block is the same across many Allwinner parts. One such part is the H3. Unfortunately it's not documented by Allwinner.
If you want to make use of the codec you'll need to use the older kernel provided by Allwinner, and their cedar core.

Cedrus is an open source alternative that makes use of community documentation of the codec registers. It's available upstream in the kernel. Great! Except it only handles decoding not encoding. :(

Searching around I found some older posts talking about hw encode on the Allwinner H3.

They mentioned these components: 
* https://github.com/uboborov/sunxi-cedar-mainline 
* https://github.com/uboborov/ffmpeg_h264_H3
* https://github.com/uboborov/cedrus

### sunxi-cedar-mainline 
This is a kernel module which when loaded creates `/dev/cedar_ve`. This file facilitates the interaction from a userspace app to the low level codec block.
What is interesting is that this project specifically list Kernel 5.7, with config. It makes use of the CMA, Continuous Memory Allocator, a part of the Linux mainline Kernel. Many repos for "cedar" seem to use an older ION system from Android, and are pinned to old kernel versions. 

### ffmpeg_h264_H3
This is a custom encoder that compiles into FFmpeg. Unfortunately this version does make use of ION, which creates a bit of a disconnect between the kernel module and the userspace code... :/

### cedrus
These small utilities are super handy, they're small single purpose applications `h264enc`, `jpeg-test`, `mpeg-test`. 

The code makes use of the CMA, and also the functions and code layout match up pretty perfectly to the FFmpeg encoder code. Combining this code into the FFmpeg looks like it might be the way to go.

## Building

So it looks like we have all the pieces for this puzzle but can we put them together..

A very simple [package](https://github.com/gregdavill/boson-s3-dev-sw/tree/7368333f0b5bcfb46ecb01c36bdba9204f738d78/buildroot/package/cedar) is added buildroot project to compile the kernel module, this also installs the module into the target filesystem.

Along with the kernel module, we need to enable the CMA, because we only have 128MB to work with I first started with 64MB.

```

A lot of the references I've seen online to working with this codec seem to set `sram_c` to `0x1d00000`. Which seems to be an empty section of memory, according to the official memory map. So I've set my device tree to point to the `sram_c` defined in the S3 datasheet, this seems to work correctly, atleast for my use cases.

Success! ðŸ¥³

The first time I tried this I hit an error trying to allocate memory, because it was attempting to allocate 80MB. Easy fix. Might be better suited to be set up the ve_size as a device tree parameter.

New we have the kernel module loaded it's time to set up FFmpeg.
Here is a diff I've applied to [FFmpeg 4.4](https://github.com/gregdavill/FFmpeg/compare/release/4.4...gregdavill:FFmpeg:cedrus264)

Not an apple to oranges comparison, because the h264 parameters are different. But you can see even on the "ultrafast" preset, the speed can't keep up with a measly 30 fps 640x512 stream.

```

I've only really started to poke around with the encoder support. But hope this write-up encourages you to give it a spin too! I'd love to see any projects you come up with utilizing the Allwinner S3!
